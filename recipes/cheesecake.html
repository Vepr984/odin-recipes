    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fabulous cheesecake will remind you of Mayfield
    creamsicle ice cream with every bite you take! I love it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon orange extract</li>
        <li>2 drops yellow food coloring</li>
        <li>1 drop red food coloring</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs and beat
        well. Beat sour cream and vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture until batter is smooth.</li>
        <li>Transfer one cup of the cream cheese mixture to a small bowl and stir in orange extract, yellow food coloring, and red
        food coloring until batter is smooth and orange.</li>
        <li>Pour uncolored batter into prepared graham cracker crust. Drop spoonfuls of orange batter over the top of the uncolored
        batter and run a knife through the orange batter to 
        create a marbled effect.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are firm and center is slightly loose, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool at room
        temperature for 1 hour. Cover cheesecake with plastic wrap 
        and chill in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    </ol>
